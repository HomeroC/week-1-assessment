    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "All the requirements for the software are specified. This gets approved by stakeholders to make sure their needs/wants are met. May include any obstacles that can arise along the way."

const design = "Models how the application will work and aspects of the design. This includes the software architecture, UI, Security, programming."

const implementation = "This is where the software code is written. It can be a small group or big team that hanlde all the different features and aspects of the project."

const testingAndIntegration = "The software is tested multiple times to make sure it runs smoothly. The more bugs that can be found/fixed before deployment will help increase usage of the software/app."

const maintain = "Once the software is deployed and in use, there can be bugs that slipped through testing. Updates are sent out to resolve any issues."
